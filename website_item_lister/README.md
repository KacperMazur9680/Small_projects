## Website item lister

This basic project was made to train my skills in finding documentations about modules on the internet (or in worst case scenario in IPython).

The purpose of this programme is to automate the process of getting specified information from a chosen website.

# Example
> python .\Small_projects\website_item_lister\website_item_lister.py
