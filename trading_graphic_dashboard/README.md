## Trading dashboard
This project is intented to help you decide on buying or selling shares from a selected company. It does so by showing you the price with it's rolling average from the past 14 days. When the price is getting lower than the rolling average, it's a sign that you should start thinking about selling the shares. In the dashboard you can see everything clearly.
