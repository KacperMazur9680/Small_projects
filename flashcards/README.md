## Flashcards
A terminal-based application that was created to help in the process of learing anything, language, geography, etc.
We can add new cards, remove them, import them from another file, export/save the term to a file, do a quiz, check the log, see statistics (which card were the hardest to guess correctly), reset statistics and exit the program.

## Example
> python .\Small_projects\flashcards\flashcards.py 

> python .\flashcards\flashcards.py --import_from=test.txt --export_to=new_test.txt
