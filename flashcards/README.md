## Flashcards
A terminal-based application that was created to help in the process of learing anything, language, geography, etc.
We can add new cards, remove them, import them from another file, export/save the term to a file, do a quiz, check the log, see statistics (which card were the hardest to guess correctly), reset statistics and exit the program.
# Update *Flashcards 2.0*
* New terminal-UI -> instead of inputing commands, the user chooses an option by inputing a corresponding number.
* New option -> when asked for an answer to a question, 2 new option appear, to see the answer or to skip the card.


## Example
> python .\Small_projects\flashcards\flashcards.py
