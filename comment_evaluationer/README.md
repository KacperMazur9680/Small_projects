## Comment evaluationer 

This code is based on machine learning. On github it uses about 2 000 txt files (1 000 positives and 1 000 negatives) but its intended to use any number we give it (i worked with 25 000 files). The purpose of this project is to automate the process of evaluating comments given (for example) on a website.
